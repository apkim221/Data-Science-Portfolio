This portfolio contains my data science projects which cover gathering, analyzing and visualizing data. You can view the code and datasets through the Github links while the Nbviewer links will allow you to see all the visualizations including interactive plots. 

## Customer Segmentation

[Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/apkim221/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Project%201/Churn%20Modeling.ipynb)

   In this project, I analyze a dataset from a bank that is experiencing high churn rates. In order to determine what factors determine      the likelihood of a customer leaving, I segment the customers and apply logistic regression to create a model that will help the bank      target specific customers to maximize retention. 

## Linear Regression

[Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/apkim221/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Project%204/Ecommerce%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

   Here, I analyze data from an ecommerce company to help decide what platform (its app or its website) it should work on to increase        customer spending using linear regression. 

## Data Exploration 
* [Github](https://github.com/apkim221/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Project%203) |
[Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/apkim221/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Project%203/Exploring%20Financial%20Data.ipynb)

   Here, we explore Python's capabilities to gather and visualize financial data that is taken directly from Google Finance. Some of the      plots include technical analyses and interactivity.

* [Github](https://github.com/apkim221/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Project%202) |
[Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/apkim221/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Project%202/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20SAT%20Scores.ipynb)

   In this project, I collect data from multiple sources on NYC high schools and perform cursory analysis on SAT scores and potential        factors influencing them. Some of the features considered include the location and demographic of each high school.
